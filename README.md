#discrete-frechet

A dive into the discrete Fréchet distance calculation, from the naïve
approach to high-speed optimizations.

The discrete Fréchet distance measures the similarity between two 
polygonal curves or poly-lines. 

This repository contains three different implementations of the 
discrete Fréchet calculation.
